How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Programs need to be easily maintainable if someone else can maintain them without asking you for help and readable if someone else, on reading it, correctly understands the design, layout, and intent.
I think that the code writing technic was applied in the CRUD code and both of my projects are very easy to read and understand. 
CRUD Python that I build can be used with any database in the future.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach any problem by trying to understand the problem first that way I can come up with the proper solution to solve that problem.
The approach for Grazioso Salvare request was to research online about the proper dog breed that is the best for a particular job.
The best strategy is to look at the client requests with their eyes to get a better understanding of what reason they need the code or program.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? 

Computer scientists will have meetings with the client before starting the project and during the project for additional feedback, this way the final product can be perfected.
